# Employee Tracker

[Video Demo](https://youtu.be/iDKgJeaHl8g)

A makeshift CLI employee tracker hooked up to a MySQL database.

# Setting up the database

If you have Docker installed, you can fire up a pre-seeded sample database with `npm run db` or `yarn db`

After that, run `npm start` or `yarn start`
